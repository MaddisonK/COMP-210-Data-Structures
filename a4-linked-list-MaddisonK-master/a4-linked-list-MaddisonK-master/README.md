# Linked List

In this assignment your task is to complete a series of algorithms using linked lists. 
The method signatures and their explanations that you need to 
 implement are provided at the top of LinkedList.java. The algorithms increase
in difficulty as you go down the page. An example of the input and expected output is also provided. 
For these algorithms you should NOT be creating a new list and returning it, you should only be manipulating the list object
that the method is called on (the object that the **this** keyword represents). 

The a4 package also contains the code for an implementation of a
Linked List. The Node class is how we represent a Node that makes up the
List and the LinkedList class has a full implementation of
the LinkedList. You should not be changing any of the completed methods at the bottom, only 
edit the first 8 methods at the top of the file. 
Look over and understand the contents of this package before starting 
on the algorithm solutions. 

An example of how to test your code is provided in Main.java.  A toString method is provided
in LinkedList.java to display the contents of the list.
