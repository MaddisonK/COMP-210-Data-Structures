Roadtrip Explanation:

    My scores for each category were from 0-5, with 0 having the least of the category in question
and 5 having the greatest, except traffic has a minimum value of 1.
My weight calculation prioritizes traffic and distance foremost but also has an emphasis on
scenery and attractions. In order prioritize traffic and distance, these values are multiplied which can create a very
large value for long distances with high traffic, which makes sense. Then scenery is scaled up 100 times and subtracted
from the weight to give that path a higher priority and attractions are scaled up by 50 times because it is not as
important as scenery.

Roadtrip Overview:

    According to my algorithm, my first stop will be at Nashville which has a path weight of 1026 from Chapel Hill,
where I will enjoy passing through Pisgah National Forest. From Nashville, I will reach Denver with a path weight of
1168 and enjoy having no traffic and the desert scenery. Denver to Phoenix will be the next trip with a weight of
1592 where I hope to see the Camelback Mountain. Finally, I will reach LA from a path weight of 769 from Phoenix or
a total path weight of 4555 from Chapel Hill and I will rest at the Santa Monica Pier and wade in the waters.
